Senior Software Engineer working in web development. My primary language is TypeScript but I also like to use other languages in my free time like C#, Rust, and Go.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a fully automated automobile insurance quoting platform using TypeScript, Temporal, and XState at Salty Insurance/CDK Global.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust & Go, Neovim/Vim keybinds in VSCode, and trying to come up with a personal tool/project to work on in my free time. I'd like to build some kind of TypeScript tool that could benefit me at work.
